# Hello, Gustavo here ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious person, developer, bread maker and sometimes write some stuff in my [blog](/a).

Welcome to my little universe at the internet ðŸŒŽðŸ˜‰

Here you will find some thoughts and links to stuff that I'm
interesting in. This web site was built by me, to me. But ou might
find something useful here.

Currently I'm workning at [aftersale](https://after.sale)
where I write code, help planning and executing product deliveries and
sometimes help people to grown in their careers.

If you want, you can catch me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gufs0z) or [email me](mailto:gustavogustav54@gmail.com).

If you really want, you can âœ¨ *install me* âœ¨ running

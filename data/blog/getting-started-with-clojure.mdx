The easiest way to get started with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/index) is through [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).

I'll start creating a new Leiningen project running `lein new app clojure-101` in my terminal. It will bootstrap a simple Clojure app.

Now change the directory and enter in the `clojure-101` app folder then run `lein run`. It should display the default message _"Hello, World"_.

I will update the file `project.clj` and include the Leiningen autorun plugin by including this line `:plugins [[lein-auto "0.1.3"]]`. The file will become the following:

```:./project.clj
(defproject clojure-101 "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "EPL-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Classpath-exception-2.0"
            :url "https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.1"]]
  :main ^:skip-aot clojure-101.core
  :target-path "target/%s"
  :plugins [[lein-auto "0.1.3"]]
  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all
                       :jvm-opts ["-Dclojure.compiler.direct-linking=true"]}})
```

Look in the line 9.

Now I'll run `lein auto run` in my terminal and this is the output:

```
> lein auto run

auto> Files changed: src\clojure_101\core.clj, test\clojure_101\core_test.clj
auto> Running: lein run
Hello, World!
auto> Completed.
```

Yay! My project is running automatically when I change any file.

This behavior is very useful to learn a new language. I need fast feedback and I don't understand the whole Clojure ecosystem to run REPL and plug that in my editor. I like to follow the easiest path that I already know.

I know how to develop using JavaScript and auto-reload server. I just want the same behavior while getting started with Clojure.

It is so easy that right now I can change the `core.clj` file and just print another message:

```:./src/clojure-101/core.clj
(ns clojure-101.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (println "Hello darkness, my old friend"))
```

Looking at the terminal, I see the new message _"Hello darkness, my old friend"_.

_This article follows the "clojure-101" project created [in this article](https://gustavosantos.dev/a/getting-started-with-clojure)._

In Clojure we have functions, data, and macros. You write and compose functions to operate over data. You can create, register and change functions through macros.

You can define things using the "function" `def`. For example:

```
(def n 42)
```

The above code defines the `n` value bounded to the value 42. For instance, to print the value in the console, we can call the function `println`:

```
(def n 42)
(println n) #=> 42
```

You should already know that, but Clojure is a LISP dialect. This means that you write programs defining functions, data structures using a lot of parentheses. It could be strange at the beginning, but this syntactical decision is great and makes a lot of sense when you discover that Clojure is a beast in the metaprogramming world.

Yeah, metaprogramming is an anti-pattern in the Object-Oriented world. But inside the scope of Clojure, metaprogramming is gold.

You can define functions using the _"function"_ `defn` as the following:

```
(defn make-magic [s]
  (str "‚ú®" s "‚ú®"))

(println (make-magic "Hello folks")) #=> ‚ú®Hello folks‚ú®
```

Talking in metaprogramming... `defn` isn't a function, it is a macro. Through macros and metaprogramming is possible to define functions in Clojure.

It uses the `def` "function" to define a body of a function and bound it to a name. You can define functions using the `def` you don't need `defn`.

```
(def increment (fn [n] (+ n 1)))
(println (increment 1)) #=> 2
```

Clojure is a language that you can change itself. You probably should not do that, but libraries can use this mechanism to offer simple and effective APIs.

For example, you can use the symbol `->` to pipe data through a set of functions. Using the above `make-magic` function we can let the Wizard make magic in a _Clojurian_ way:

```
(defn make-magic [s]
  (str "‚ú®" s "‚ú®"))

(->
 (make-magic "The wizard")
  println) #=> ‚ú®The wizard‚ú®
```

If you inspect (yeah, you can inspect the language) the `->` symbol you will discover that this arrow is another macro.

```
=> (doc ->)
-------------------------
clojure.core/->
([x & forms])
Macro
  Threads the expr through the forms. Inserts x as the
  second item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a
  list already. If there are more forms, inserts the first form as the
  second item in second form, etc.
nil
```

Be warned that the above command only works in the REPL.

If you are a JavaScript developer, you create a bunch of values inside the scope of a function. You can do that using Clojure `let` keyword:

```
(defn SCREAM [x]
  (let [screamedX (st/upper-case x)]
    (str screamedX "!!!")))

(println (SCREAM "hi folks")) #=> HI FOLKS!!!
```

_To run the above code, I have defined the `(:require [clojure.string :as st])` line at the namespace of the file._

## In a nutshell
- The idea is to define functions, data and operate over data. The language will offer you tools, APIs, techniques, and a whole ecosystem to deal with data nice as possible.
- You can define things using the `def` keyword
- You can call things putting them as the first symbol before the opening parenthesis: `(+ 1 2)`, `(inc 1)`, `(make-magic "üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è")`
- You can define intermediary values inside a function using the `let` function
- You should face Clojure as a bunch of computation using "forms" over data, and _data_ could be almost anything.

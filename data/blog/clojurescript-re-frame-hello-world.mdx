Let's get started by creating the project running `lein new re-frame reframe-hello-world +10x`:

```
> lein new re-frame reframe-hello-world +10x
Generating re-frame project.
```

Now I'll enter the project directory and run `yarn` to install all Node.js dependencies. At this time, the `shadow-cljs` will download the ClojureScript dependencies and setup the project for us.

Then I will run `yarn watch` to start the development server. After build the application, I will be able to access it at `http://localhost:8280`.

Nice, fast feedback already setup ðŸ’ª.

My Hello World is a application that displays a counter and two buttons. One of them increments the counter and the another decrements the same counter.

This application is a re-frame application. So it already have a reactive state management library already setup. I will use that.

The initial state is declared in the `db.cljs` file:

```:db.cljs
(ns reframe-hello-world.db)

(def default-db
  {:name "re-frame"})
```

This database is loaded when the application. You can view the definition in the `events.cljs` file:

```:events.cljs
(ns reframe-hello-world.events
(:require
  [re-frame.core :as re-frame]
  [reframe-hello-world.db :as db]
  [day8.re-frame.tracing :refer-macros [fn-traced
  ))

(re-frame/reg-event-db
  ::initialize-db
  (fn-traced [_ _]
    db/default-db))
```

The `::initialize-db` is dispatched when the application mounts. This behavior is defined in the `core.cljs` file:

```:core.cljs
;; More code above

(defn init []
  (re-frame/dispatch-sync [::events/initialize-db])
  (dev-setup)
  (mount-root))
```

When the application init, the first thing that happens is the dispatch of the event `::initialize-db`, then the dev setup is configured and the root application is mounted in the dom. re-frame uses Reagent behind the scenes. Reagent uses React.

Ok, what happens if I change the default state of the application to `{:name "Hello World"}` in the `db.cljs` file?

```:db.cljs
(ns reframe-hello-world.db)

(def default-db
  {:name "Hello World"})
```

# Pipeline

When you need to compose two or more functions where the result of the first function application is the argument for the second function and so on, then the `pipeline` function could be useful.

## Code

```js label=pipeline.js
const pipeline = (...fns) =>
  (...args) =>
    fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), args)
```

Pipeline is just a function that receives a list of functions then return a function that takes the initial argument (or arguments) and call all the functions in order.

## Example

```js
const f = (x) => `f(${x})`
const g = (x) => `g(${x})`
const h = (x) => `h(${x})`

const w = pipeline(f, g, h)
w(10, 11) //=> h(g(f(10,11)))
```
